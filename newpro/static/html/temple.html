The Thanumalayan Temple, also called Sthanumalayan Temple is an 
important Hindu temple located in Suchindram in the Kanyakumari
district of Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the 108 shiva temple 
revered by the Kerala Hindu culture, though this temple is now in 
Tamil Nadu, when Kanyakumari District got merged into Tamil Nadu from 
Travancore. The Thanumalayan Temple is of importance to both 
Shaivaite and Vaishnavite sects of Hinduism, as the name Stanumalaya 
denotes Trimurtis; "Stanu" means Siva; "Mal" means Vishnu; and the "Ayan"
means Brahma.
