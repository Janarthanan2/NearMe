Kanyakumari is a coastal town in the state of Tamil Nadu on 
India's southern tip. Jutting into the Laccadive Sea, the town
was known as Cape Comorin during British rule and is popular 
for watching sunrise and sunset over the ocean. It's also a 
noted pilgrimage site thanks to its Bagavathi Amman Temple, 
dedicated to a consort of Shiva, and its Our Lady of Ransom 
Church, a center of Indian Catholicism.
